# Agents in SDLC — Workshop Content

Workshop content for **Agents in SDLC**, a guided exploration of GitHub Copilot's agentic capabilities (Copilot CLI, VS Code agent mode, and the Copilot cloud agent) across the software development lifecycle.

The published site lives at **<https://github-samples.github.io/agents-in-sdlc/>**.

> [!NOTE]
> The demo application learners build through during the workshop — Tailspin Toys, a pure-Astro crowdfunding site (SSR, API endpoints, and a Drizzle data layer) — lives in a separate repository: **<https://github.com/github-samples/tailspin-toys>**. This repo holds only the *content*: lesson Markdown, images, and the Astro + Starlight site that publishes them.

## Start the workshop

Visit the published site: <https://github-samples.github.io/agents-in-sdlc/>.

## Authoring

If you want to add or edit content, start with **[AUTHORING.md](./AUTHORING.md)**. It has the mental model, file map, and step-by-step recipes for adding lessons and images.

For PR/CI rules, see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Repository structure

- **`docs/`** — **Lesson source (plain Markdown). Edit here.** Browsable directly on github.com, no build required.
  - `README.md` — Workshop landing page (also the published site's home via `slug: index`).
  - `cli/`, `vscode/`, `cloud/`, `app/` — Per-harness lessons (Copilot CLI / VS Code / cloud agent / GitHub Copilot app). Each codespace-based harness opens with its own `0-prerequisites.md` setup lesson.
  - `es-es/`, `ja-jp/`, `ko-kr/`, `pt-br/`, `zh-cn/` — Translated locale trees (currently the app harness).
  - `_images/` — Screenshots and diagrams (shared across all locales).
- **`website/`** — Optional Astro + Starlight site that publishes `docs/` to GitHub Pages. Only needed to self-host or preview the rendered site.
  - `astro.config.mjs` — Site URL, base path, `locales` block, sidebar.
  - `src/content.config.ts` — Content loader (`base: '../docs'`).
  - `src/pages/shared/0-prereqs.astro` — Full-HTML redirect forwarding the legacy `/shared/0-prereqs/` URL to the home page.
- **`AUTHORING.md`** — Author entry point (recipes for adding/editing content).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — PR flow + CI requirements.
- **`.github/`**
  - `copilot-instructions.md` + `instructions/*.md` — Authoring guidance for Copilot.
  - `agents/`, `skills/` — Custom agents and skills available to Copilot in this repo.
  - `workflows/pages.yml` — Builds and deploys the site on pushes to `main`.

## Local development

From the repo root:

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site runs at <http://localhost:4321/agents-in-sdlc/>.

## Verification

Before opening a PR, build the site and run the full verification sequence — clean build, page-count check, and offline link check (lychee). The canonical commands live in **[AUTHORING.md → Building and verifying](./AUTHORING.md#building-and-verifying)** and the [`build-and-verify-docs`](./.github/skills/build-and-verify-docs/SKILL.md) skill. CI (`pages.yml`) runs the build and the lychee link check.
