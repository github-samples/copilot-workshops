In this optional lesson you'll take the Tailspin catalog and build an AI agent on top of it, discovering and deploying a model, scaffolding an agent locally, deploying it as a Foundry hosted agent and wiring it into the site.

Before you start this exercise, you need a few tools.
## Prerequisites & setup

1. An Azure Subscription

    - [Free Azure subscription with $200 credit][azure-free]
    - [Azure for Students with $100 credits][azure-students]

1. Foundry Toolkit Extension for VS Code

   The foundry toolkit extension brings the full agent workflow — model discovery, deployment, prompt engineering, evaluation, and agent deployment into the editor, so you don't leave the code to build the AI feature. Install the extension from the Marketplace:

   - Open VS Code and select Extensions from the Activity Bar.
   - Search for Foundry Toolkit.
   - Select Install.

    After installation, the Foundry Toolkit icon appears in the Activity Bar.

1. Sign in to Azure
    - Select the Azure icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Select Sign in to Azure….
    - Choose the subscription you'll use for the Foundry project.

    With the toolkit installed and authenticated, Copilot can use the [Microsoft Foundry Skill][foundry-skill] to provision resources and models for you in a conversational style, instead of another portal experience.

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)**

   Deploying your agent as a Foundry hosted agent is driven by `azd`, so install it before you start:

   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
   curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   winget install microsoft.azd
   ```

   then sign in:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

All set.

## Scenario

In a previous exercise, you added a new feature that allows users to filter by category and publisher. But filtering only helps backers who already know what they want. The ones emailing support ask things like *which of your games would suit someone who loves git puns?*. Questions with no dropdown answers. In this exercise you build a **Backer Concierge** agent that answers those questions, grounded in the Tailspin catalog so it never invents a game or a funding number.

Open a new Copilot Chat (Agent mode), ask:

```
Show me the open issue about a Backer Concierge assistant and summarize its acceptance criteria.
```

Copilot reads the backlog and surfaces **Add a Backer Concierge assistant for catalog questions.** Note that the criteria are clear — grounded answers, no invented funding numbers, one clarifying question, and an accessible UI with e2e coverage.

## Generate the catalog export

The agent needs the catalog as a file it can read. That export already exists as a script.

1. Open a new terminal by selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd>.

1. Make sure any work from the previous lesson is committed or pushed. This next command creates and switches to a new branch for this feature work:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b foundry-agent-vscode
   ```

1. Migrate, seed and write `db/catalog.json`:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run db:setup
   npm run db:export
   ```

Open `db/catalog.json`. Twenty-one games - each with a title, description, category, publisher and star rating, plus a `note` field stating what the catalog *doesn't* contain. Nothing about funding totals, backer counts, pledge tiers, or release dates. That absence is exactly the boundary your agent has to respect.

## Set up a Foundry project

Your agent needs a place to live, so let's set up a project on Microsoft Foundry.

1. Select the Foundry Toolkit icon in the Activity Bar.
1. Expand the Help and Feedback section and select Ask Copilot.

   This drops a prompt into Copilot Chat that uses the `/foundrytk-quick-start` skill to guide you through setup. Confirm your model of choice from the dropdown and send the prompt.

   ![Screenshot showing the Foundry Toolkit quickstart sequence.](../_images/vscode-foundry-setup.png)

1. Copilot starts an interactive workflow. Answer as follows:

   - **Where are you starting from?** → *Set up Foundry*
   - **What do you have already?** → *I have an Azure subscription or Foundry resources*

   > [!TIP]
   > Select **Allow azmcp …** for this session to cut down on repeated approval prompts.

1. The **Microsoft Foundry: Create Project** wizard opens in VS Code. Fill it in:

   - **Choose a resource group** → *Create new resource group*
   - **Enter resource group name** → `rg-tailspin-toys`
   - **Choose a location** → pick a region close to you that offers the models you want. `East US 2` and `Sweden Central` have the broadest model availability so if you're unsure, start there.
   - **Enter project name** → `tailspin-toys`

    Once the project is created you'll get a notification that deployment succeeded. 

1. In the Foundry Toolkit view, expand My Resources. Your new project should be set as the default.

## Discover, deploy and test a model

The model you pick is a critical piece of the agent's behavior and capabilities. It's tempting to just grab the biggest, most capable model available and move on, but for a use case like this, biggest, newest and most expensive model won't necessarily be the most suitable.

What actually matters is whether the model can follow rules reliably and its grounding fidelity - *will it obey hard rules about never inventing games, ratings, funding numbers ...* 

Rather than guessing from model reputation, hand Copilot the actual acceptance criteria from the issue and let it argue the trade-offs for you.

- To attach the issue as context, on the chat window:
    - Click +
    - Select GitHub Issues
    - Choose the *Add a Backer Concierge assistant for catalog questions* issue
    - Then use the following prompt:

        ```
        /microsoft-foundry recommend a model for the agent described in this issue. There's no math or multi-step planning here, so reasoning depth isn't a priority. Prioritize speed instead. Recommend 2-3 candidates available in my Azure region with the trade-offs between them, tell me which you'd pick and why, and check my quota.
        ```

![Screenshot showing the model recommendations from Copilot.](../_images/vscode-model-recommendation-prompt.png)

Read through the recommendations and facts presented and make a judgement call on which model to use. We'll continue with `gpt-4.1-mini` in this workshop. 

### Deploy model

Next, ask Copilot to deploy the model with:

```
/microsoft-foundry deploy gpt-4.1-mini and use the model name as the deployment name
```

If prompted, confirm project and deployment.

> [!TIP]
> Select **Allow az …** for this session to cut down on repeated approval prompts.

Once the model is deployed:

- Click on the foundry toolkit icon in the activity bar
- Expand the My Resources section and click Models. 

    This will open the models page and your deployed model should show up under Foundry

    ![Screenshot showing the model page with gpt-4.1.mini deployed.](../_images/vscode-model-deployed.png)

You deployed the model purely on Copilot's recommendation, so before going any further, take a minute to test and validate that it meets your expectations.

### Test deployed model

The Model Playground doesn't have your catalog file, so for this test you'll paste a **trimmed 9-game subset** directly into the system prompt. That's enough to prove the model follows grounding rules.

From the Models page, select the model name to open the Model Playground with the model pre-filled.

<details>
<summary>Use the following as your system prompt (click to expand)</summary>

```text
You're the Backer Concierge for Tailspin Toys. Only recommend games from this catalog — never invent games, publishers, ratings, or any funding/price/date info. If a request is vague, ask one short question first.

CATALOG

| Title | Category | Publisher | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bug Buster Brainteaser | Puzzle | GitHub Games | 3.0 |
| Merge Conflict Mystery | Puzzle | DevMasters Inc. | 3.8 |
| Stack Trace Secrets | Puzzle | Ops Interactive | 3.6 |
| Deployment Dynasty | Simulation | Ops Interactive | 5.0 |
| Script Strike | Action | CodeForge Studios | 5.0 |
| Pipeline Conquest | Strategy | DevMasters Inc. | 3.9 |
| Repo Rulers | Strategy | Ops Interactive | 4.1 |
| Server Siege | Strategy | GitHub Games | 3.3 |
| Code Quest Odyssey | Adventure | CodeForge Studios | 4.8 |
```

</details>

Expand **Inference parameters** and set **temperature** to **0.2** for highly deterministic responses.

Your test cases may include:

1. **Grounded in our data?**

   Prompt: `I love puzzle games about tracking down bugs. What should I back?`

   Expected: Names real titles from the list with the correct game information for each.

1. **Hallucination trap**

   Prompt 1: `How much has Pipeline Conquest raised so far, and how many backers does it have?`

   Expected: A clean refusal — the catalog doesn't track funding or backers — followed by what it *does* know

   Prompt 2: `I need something for four players, about an hour long.`

   Expected: Explains the catalog has no player count or play time, then asks one actionable follow-up question

1. **Out-of-catalog pressure**

   Prompt: `Do you have Wingspan? If not, what's the closest thing you've got?`

   Expected: Says Wingspan isn't in the catalog, doesn't describe it from outside knowledge, and pivots to real Tailspin titles.

1. **Vagueness — does it ask, or guess?**

   Prompt: `Recommend me something good.`

   Expected: One short clarifying question — no recommendation until it knows category or theme.

1. **Ranking accuracy**

   Prompt: `What are your three highest rated games?`

   Expected: Deployment Dynasty and Script Strike at 5.0, then Code Quest Odyssey at 4.8 — correct order, correct numbers.

Your model is ready. Next - create the agent.

## Create the Backer Concierge agent locally

1. Select the Foundry Toolkit icon in the Activity Bar.
1. Expand Developer Tools → + Build, then select + Create Agent.

   The Create Agent page opens. Select the dropdown next to **Generate with Copilot** and choose **Simple Agent**.

   ![Screenshot showing the create agent page.](../_images/vscode-create-agent.png)

This drops a prompt into a new Copilot Chat and automatically switches to the **AIAgentExpert** custom agent, which specializes in end-to-end Microsoft Foundry workflows.

<details>
<summary>Customize the default prompt to fit our scenario (click to expand)</summary>

```text
/foundrytk-quick-start Create a backer concierge AI agent called 'Backer Concierge'. The agent should use the model I deployed to answer catalog questions and recommend games grounded strictly in db/catalog.json. It must never invent games, publishers, ratings, funding totals, backer counts, or release dates, and it should ask one short clarifying question when a request is vague. Generate the code into agent/backer-concierge in the current workspace and ask me if anything is unclear.
```

</details>

Copilot scaffolds and configures the agent in a few minutes, writing the generated code to `agent/`. Once it's done, use the **Agent Inspector** to debug and step through its behavior:

1. Select Run and Debug in the Activity Bar.
1. Start the debugger (<kbd>F5</kbd>).
1. The Agent Inspector page loads and connects to your agent server.
1. Test your agent — reuse the prompts from the playground section above.
1. Switch between Input & Output, Events, and Tools to inspect the request/response payloads, individual session events and any tool calls.

![Screenshot showing local Agent debug workflow.](../_images/vscode-agent-debug.png)

At this point your agent runs locally against the model you deployed to Foundry. Next - deploy the agent itself.

## Deploy your Agent on Foundry

Back on the copilot chat, you'll notice a few hand-off buttons were presented for recommended next actions as part of the agent creation process.

Select the `Go production` hand-off option, edit the default prompt to:

```
/foundrytk-quick-start Deploy agent to my existing tailspin-toys project on foundry
```

and submit the prompt.

![Screenshot showing hand off options from the AIAgentExpert agent.](../_images/vscode-go-production-handoff.png)

Copilot will prepare your agent code service as a Foundry hosted-agent deployment and kick that off.
Observe the chat and terminal in case any actions are required from you, i.e, passing in parameters for azd commands.

> [!NOTE]
> If Copilot offers to set up an evaluation suite for the deployed agent, you can accept and work through it as a bonus step.

- Click on the foundry toolkit icon in the activity bar
- Expand the My Resources section, then click Agents.
- On the Agents tab, switch to Hosted Agent to view your newly deployed agent

    ![Screenshot showing the deployed hosted agent.](../_images/vscode-agent-deployed.png)

- Click on the agent name to open it in the Hosted agent playground, and confirm the deployment status is Running 
- Switch to the Playground tab, and test the hosted-agent

    ![Screenshot showing a response from the deployed hosted agent.](../_images/vscode-agent-response.png)

## Bring it all together

TODO: brainstorming static website constraint

![Screenshot showing an example integration.](../_images/vscode-ask-the-backer-concierge.png)

## Clean up your resources

When you're done experimenting, tear everything down to avoid any unwanted costs:

```bash
azd down --purge
```

Or delete the resource group directly:

```bash
az group delete --name rg-tailspin-toys --yes --no-wait
```

> [!WARNING]
> `azd down --purge` permanently removes the Foundry project, the model deployment, and the hosted agent. Only run it once you've finished exploring.

## Summary

In this lesson you took a feature request from the backlog all the way to a deployed AI agent wired into the product. Along the way you:

- Generated a grounded data source (`db/catalog.json`) 
- Chose a model from acceptance criteria and quota rather than reputation, then deployed it
- Validated grounding behavior in the Model Playground before writing any agent code
- Scaffolded and debugged the agent locally with the Agent Inspector
- Deployed it as a Foundry hosted agent and tested it in the playground
